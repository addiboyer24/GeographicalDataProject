        <details><h3>Number of Australians who identified as Anglican in the 2011 Census.</h3>

        <p>The following visualization shows the number of people in Australia (by region) that identified as Anglican in 2015.  This is an example of a bad way to represent geographical data.  Although the visualization utilizes a color map, its max and min values are highly ambiguous.  Also, they are not equally spaced, and leave the viewer unable to easily identify the values corresponding to regions on the map.  Therefore, the visual is not easy to make comparisons.  Also, due to its ambiguity the axes of the visual are not clear.  The visual is lacking an overall cohesiveness that would make it an effective visual for supporting a hypothesis.</p>

        <details><h3>Population change for the year 2015.</h3>

        <p><i>"All maps are <b>wrong</b>, but some are useful"</i></p>
        <p>The following visualization shows population change for the year 2015 in the United States.  This is an example of a good way to represent geographical data.  The visualization uses a nice color map, and the legend is clearly labeled with equally incremented values.  The distinct colors allow the user to make comparisons easily and reach a conclusion about the data.  The Albers USA projection is used to reduce distortion of the continental United States.  Also, the density of data being represented is consistent with a good example.  Although the map only showâ€™s one year of population change, it could be used to hypothesized which states contain the greatest number of elderly people, or conversely the greatest number of newborns.  This visualization, along with supplemental information has great potential to be used to support a hypothesis.</p>
