        <h2 id="vis1"><a href="countryeconomy.html">Visualization 1</a> - Supporting</h2>
        <p>This visualization shows countries on a projected plane, and their respective economic statuses from one to seven.  One represents nations that are developed, and seven represents nations that are undeveloped.  Firstly, the visual utilizes a simple color scale, and shades the countries according to their economic statuses.  This color scale in conjunction with the key on the left-hand side make it easy to determine the  economic status of a country, and to make comparisons between many countries.  Filtering options are available in the top left and enable the viewer to add and remove layers from the map.  More specifically, the viewer can add global locations of oil and petroleum as well as locations of interstate disputes since 1990.  The viewer can add and remove these layers as they see fit to make comparisons.  When the viewer clicks on a dispute, they receive information about the dispute (location, and year).  Also, when the user hovers over an area of oil or petroleum, information about that area appears in the header.  This visual supports the hypothesis in many ways.  Adding layers one by one, the areas with high oil and petroleum deposits as well as frequency of interstate disputes can be identified.  Next, when all layers are removed from these areas and the economic status is observed by hovering over the country it is generally in the range of 4-5.  Also, when areas of high petroleum and oil concentration, and 1-3 economic status are observed they generally contain very low numbers of interstate disputes.  The visual is consistent with good examples of how-to represent geographical data in many ways.  The visuals display a high density of data without distorting the data.  The ability to add and subtract layers adds to this substantially.  Also, despite from the stereographic projection, the visual is distortion free.  This allows the viewer to easily make comparisons and reach a clear conclusion about the data.</p>
        
        <h2 id="vis2"><a href="countryincome.html">Visualization 2</a> - Supporting</h2>
        <p>This visualization shows countries on a projected plane, and their respective income groups from one to five.  One represents nations that are wealthy, and seven represents nations that have low incomes.  Firstly, the visual utilizes a simple color scale, and shades the countries according to their income.  This color scale in conjunction with the key on the left-hand side make it easy to determine the income group of a country, and to make comparisons between many countries.  Filtering options are available in the top left and enable the viewer to add and remove layers from the map.  More specifically, the viewer can add global locations of oil and petroleum as well as locations of interstate disputes since 1990.  The viewer can add and remove these layers as they see fit to make comparisons.  When the viewer clicks on a dispute, they receive information about the dispute (location, and year).  Also, when the user hovers over an area of oil or petroleum, information about that area appears in the header.  This visual supports the hypothesis in many ways.  Adding layers one by one, the areas with high oil and petroleum deposits as well as frequency of interstate disputes can be identified.  Next, when all layers are removed from these areas and the income group is observed by hovering over the country it is generally in the range of 3-4.  Also, when areas of high petroleum and oil concentration, and 1-2 income group are observed they generally contain very low numbers of interstate disputes.  The visual is consistent with good examples of how-to represent geographical data in many ways.  The visuals display a high density of data without distorting the data.  The ability to add and subtract layers adds to this substantially.  Also, despite from the Mercator projection, the visual is distortion free.  This allows the viewer to easily make comparisons and reach a clear conclusion about the data.</p>
        <h2 id="vis3"><a href="countryeconomyandincome.html">Visualization 3</a> - Supporting</h2>
        <p>This visualization shows countries on a projected plane, and their respective sum of economic status and income groups from two to twelve.  Two represents nations that are both wealthy as well as developed, and twelve represents nations that have both low incomes and are undeveloped.  Firstly, the visual utilizes a simple color scale, and shades the countries according to the sum of their economic status and income.  This color scale in conjunction with the key on the left-hand side make it easy to determine the total economic status / income group of a country, and to make comparisons between many countries.  Filtering options are available in the top left and enable the viewer to add and remove layers from the map.  More specifically, the viewer can add global locations of oil and petroleum as well as locations of interstate disputes since 1990.  The viewer can add and remove these layers as they see fit to make comparisons.  When the viewer clicks on a dispute, they receive information about the dispute (location, and year).  Also, when the user hovers over an area of oil or petroleum, information about that area appears in the header.  This visual supports the hypothesis in many ways.  Adding layers one by one, the areas with high oil and petroleum deposits as well as frequency of interstate disputes can be identified.  Next, when all layers are removed from these areas and the combined economic status / income group is observed by hovering over the country it is generally in the range of 6-10.  Also, when areas of high petroleum and oil concentration, and 2-5 income group are observed they generally contain very low numbers of interstate disputes.  The visual is consistent with good examples of how-to represent geographical data in many ways.  The visuals display a high density of data without distorting the data.  The ability to add and subtract layers adds to this substantially.  Also, despite from the Equirectangular projection, the visual is distortion free.  This allows the viewer to easily make comparisons and reach a clear conclusion about the data.</p>
        
        <h2 id="vis4"><a href="africarefuting.html">Visualization 4</a> - Refuting</h2>
        <p>This visualization shows countries on a projected plane, and their respective sum of economic status and income groups from two to twelve.  Two represents nations that are both wealthy as well as developed, and twelve represents nations that have both low incomes and are undeveloped.

More specifically, the viewer can add global locations of oil and petroleum as well as locations of interstate disputes since 1990.  The viewer can add and remove these layers as they see fit to make comparisons.  When the viewer clicks on a dispute, they receive information about the dispute (location, and year).  Also, when the user hovers over an area of oil or petroleum, information about that area appears in the header.  This visual supports the hypothesis in many ways, but also refutes it too.  If we focus on northern Africa, we can see an area of high petroleum and oil concentration where interstate disputes are low.  This refutes the hypothesis because these are lower income developing nations with abundant oil, yet they do not have a higher frequency of interstate disputes.</p>
